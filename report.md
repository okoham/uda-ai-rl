a report describing your learning algorithm. This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, along with ideas for future work.

# Report

## Learning Algorithm

DQN paper: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf


- algorithm
- chosen hyperparameters
- NN architecture

## Plot of Rewards

- show that average reward over 100 episodes
- report number of episodes needed to solve the environment
- gif/youtube video of trained agent

## Ideas for future work

- concrete ideas for improving the agent's performance
- double dqn, dueling dqn, proritized experience replay
- sequence of states
